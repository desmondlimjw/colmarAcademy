## Introduction
**Description:** This is a responsive website built using html and vanilla CSS, as part of an assessment for the SGUP-CT Junior Full-Stack Developer bootcamp.

**Tools used:** HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Media Queries)

## Reflections
**What did you like about this project?**
1. Getting to practise plain CSS without frameworks like Bootstrap
2. Practising media queries

**What did you struggle with in this project?**
1. Time management - wished we had two days to do it!
2. Media queries took some time - had to check back on desktop view again to see if any changes from the mobile view affected it

**What would make your experience with this assessment better?**
1. Practice more on my own - as much as time permits
