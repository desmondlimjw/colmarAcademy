## Reflections
**What did you like about this project?**
1. Getting to practise plain CSS without frameworks like Bootstrap
2. Practising media queries

**What did you struggle with in this project?**
1. Time management - wished we had two days to do it!
2. Media queries took some time - had to check back on desktop view again to see if any changes from the mobile view affected it

**What would make your experience with this assessment better?**
1. Practice more on my own - as much as time permits
