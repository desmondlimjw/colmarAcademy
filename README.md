What did you like about this project?
1. Get to recap plain CSS without frameworks like Bootstrap
2. Practicing media queries

What did you struggle with in this project?
1. Time management - wished we had two days to do it
2. Media queries took some time - had to check back on desktop view again to see if any changes from the mobile view affected it

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
1. Practice more on my own - as much as time permits
